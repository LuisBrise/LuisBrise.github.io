We developed an efficient numerical implementation for computing momentum transfer from swift electrons to large spherical nanoparticles driven by optical excitations. The computational framework is publicly available as an open-source package.

## Software

The complete implementation is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/LuisBrise/AMTSolver). Installation and usage instructions are provided in the repository documentation.
