## Overview

In this work, we investigate angular momentum transfer from single swift electrons to non-spherical metallic nanoparticles, with particular focus on spheroidal and polyhedral (Platonic solid) geometries. While previous studies have primarily examined spherical nanoparticles, we extend this understanding by systematically exploring how particle shape affects electron–matter interactions.

## Approach

Using classical electrodynamics within the small particle limit, we calculate angular momentum transfer by integrating the spectral density while ensuring causality through Fourier-transform analysis. This framework allows us to isolate the geometric contributions to plasmonic behavior.

## Key Findings

Our results reveal distinct geometric dependencies:

**Spheroidal particles:** Prolate nanoparticles exhibit a single blueshifted plasmonic resonance compared to spheres of equivalent volume, resulting in reduced angular momentum transfer. In contrast, oblate particles display two resonances—one blueshifted and one redshifted—yielding enhanced angular momentum transfer relative to spherical counterparts.

**Platonic solids:** Polyhedra with fewer faces show significant redshifts in plasmonic resonances, leading to increased angular momentum transfer due to edge effects. We also observe characteristic resonances and similar angular momentum transfer patterns in dual Platonic solid pairs, reflecting their geometric symmetry relationships.

## Implications

These findings have promising applications in electron tweezers technology, where precise control of angular momentum transfer is essential for nanoparticle manipulation. The geometric tunability demonstrated here opens new avenues for designing particle-electron interaction systems with tailored optical and mechanical properties.
