## Overview

We developed a fully causal electrodynamical framework to compute linear momentum transfer from swift electrons to large spherical nanoparticles (up to 50 nm radius), extending beyond previous small-particle approximations.

## Key Findings

Our analysis of aluminum and bismuth nanoparticles reveals that transverse linear momentum transfer is consistently **attractive** toward the electron trajectory across all parameters studied. This momentum arises primarily from near-field interference between the electron's electromagnetic field and the scattered field—not from radiation pressure.

## Significance

These results establish a robust baseline for isolated spherical nanoparticles. Any observed repulsive behavior in experiments must stem from effects beyond our model: substrate interactions, charging, nonlocal effects, thermal gradients, or geometric deviations.

This framework provides quantitative benchmarks for electron tweezers technology and can be extended to nonspherical geometries, chiral particles, and collective interactions.
