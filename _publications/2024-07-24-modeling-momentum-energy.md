## Overview

We developed a numerical method to compute the polarizability (α) of small cubic nanoparticles, enhancing our understanding of their electromagnetic response and plasmonic resonance distributions. This approach requires knowledge of the plasmonic resonance distribution and, ideally, the number of resonances for each nanoparticle geometry.

By integrating Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) probability with momentum spectral density, we quantified electron–nanoparticle interactions. This analysis revealed how plasmonic resonance distributions directly influence observable quantities such as energy loss and momentum transfer.

## Key Results

Our findings demonstrate the robustness of this methodology—variations in polynomial fit degrees produced minimal discrepancies in the computed values. This consistency validates the approach for modeling diverse nanoparticle geometries.

## Future Directions

These results establish a foundation for extending this computational framework to various polyhedral nanoparticles, including irregular geometries. This capability will advance our ability to predict and analyze momentum transfer and energy loss in swift electron interactions across a broad range of nanostructures.
