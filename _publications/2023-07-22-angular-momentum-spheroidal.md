We calculated angular momentum transfer from swift electrons to small spheroidal nanoparticles using the dipole approximation. Our results demonstrate that nanoparticle geometry significantly affects angular momentum transfer—enhancement or reduction occurs depending on how plasmonic resonances shift across different frequencies.

These findings suggest that geometric engineering could optimize angular momentum transfer for nanomanipulation applications, particularly in advancing electron tweezers technology.
