I am a physicist and PhD candidate specializing in Condensed Matter and Nanosciences at [UNAM](https://www.posgrado.fisica.unam.mx/). My research focuses on electron–matter interactions through classical electrodynamics and quantum mechanics approaches, with particular emphasis on developing efficient numerical solutions to complex physical problems.

## Research Interests

* Theoretical Electron Microscopy
* Numerical Methods
* Nanoplasmonics
* Vibrational EELS

## Background

I completed my Master of Science in 2023, investigating [angular momentum transfer from swift electrons to large nanoparticles](https://tesiunam.dgb.unam.mx:443/F/LG9EVDVESL5DPISRX6H5NPCVVA51YMBSBB3MYY94X6HQ8BABTR-36426?func=service&doc_library=TES01&doc_number=000841387&line_number=0001&func_code=WEB-FULL&service_type=MEDIA). During my doctoral studies, I have extended this work to optimize computational methods and analyze angular momentum transfer across various materials and particle sizes. Leveraging GRID-UNAM's supercomputing resources, I have developed robust and efficient computational frameworks for these investigations.

Through the AALD-PAEP-UNAM research visit grant, I had the opportunity to collaborate with [Dr. Jan Rusz](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N7-244) at the Materials Theory Department, Uppsala University. During this visit, we worked on developing an efficient implementation of the magnetic multislice solution to study magnons within the EELS spectrum of electron microscopes.
