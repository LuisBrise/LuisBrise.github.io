## About This Project

This is my personal recipe collection (in Spanish), compiled and typeset using LaTeX for a clean, professional presentation. The book includes recipes I've collected over time, ranging from traditional dishes to personal experiments in the kitchen.

### Why LaTeX?

Using LaTeX for a recipe book might seem unconventional, but it offers several advantages:
* Consistent, professional formatting
* Easy version control with Git
* Simple to add new recipes over time
* Beautiful PDF output
* Modular structure for organizing recipes by category

## Downloads

* [Download Recipe Book (PDF)](/files/Recipe_book/Recettes.pdf)
* [View LaTeX Source on GitHub](https://https://github.com/LuisBrise/LuisBrise.github.io/tree/main/files/Recipe_book)

## Structure

The recipe book is organized into sections:
* Masa Madre (Sourdough)
* La Levadura al rescate (Yeast breads)

Each recipe includes ingredients, preparation time, cooking instructions, and personal notes.
