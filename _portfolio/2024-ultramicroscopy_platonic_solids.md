This work builds on the [pioneering study by Castellanos et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2021.113274), which used the dipolar approximation to compute angular momentum transfer from electrons to spherical nanoparticles. We extended these methods to non-spherical geometries, exploring two distinct classes: Platonic solids and ellipsoids.

Our calculations revealed that particle geometry significantly affects plasmonic behavior. Unlike spherical particles, which exhibit a single dipolar resonance, non-spherical nanoparticles display multiple dipolar resonances with geometry-dependent frequency shifts. These findings provide new insights into how particle shape influences electron–matter interactions at the nanoscale.
